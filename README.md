# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means algorithm
# ***PROBLEM STATEMENT***
Customer segmentation in retail business is vital to the success of modern enterprises. The sudden change in consumer expectations has led to the rise of targeted personalization. Customer segmentation is the proven method of ensuring that the e-commerce business remains profitable despite intense competition in an unpredictable business environment.

Customer segmentation is of uttermost importance in E-commerce business because it helps in building stronger customer relationships, improve product offerings, and accurately guides efficient marketing campaigns.

In this project, we will be using K-means clustering algorithm to identify different customer segments or clusters which classify different customers into different categories.We will be using a given dataset of online retail e-commerce company.

*K-means clustering* is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for grouping data points into a predefined number of clusters (k) based on similarity.
